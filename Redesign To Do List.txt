Next Redesign Notes and To-Do

As a first web project, this taught me a lot about DOM interactions and web design. Coming back to this project later with more knowledge will allow me to do it "more right". The following are ideas I would like to incorporate:

- Cross-browser testing

- A simpler gameEnd funciton that handles dealer reveal, winner deciding, and state changes. These are all a bit copmplicated now. 

- Set an event for when bankroll reaches 0

- Add animations and transitions so the game doesn't feel so abrupt

- Track the users who play so you can save an retain bankroll information 

- Hide inputs so that DOM manipulation cannot hack the game

- Fix spacing issue with dealer-sum-box

- make responsive for mobile use

- Improve styling of betting area

- Add chips to increment and decrement the bet

- Add chip animations

- Find a better card back image for unseen dealer card

- BUG - Reveals what dealer has when you hit deal
